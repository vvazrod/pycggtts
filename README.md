# pycggtts

Python package to perform remote clock comparison using CGGTTS files.

## Credit

This package is basically a Python re-implementation of the
[gwbres/cggtts](https://github.com/gwbres/cggtts) Rust crate. The purpose of this
package is to allow users to work with CGGTTS data in environments where Python is a
more natural choice than Rust (data visualization, machine learning, etc.).
